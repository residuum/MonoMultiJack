About MonoMultiJack

MonoMultJack (MMJ) aims to be an application for musicians, who regularly
have to deal with multiple programs to start and create and maintain
audio connections via jackd.

MMJ is written in C# using the Mono framework and is licensed with an
MIT (or as the FSF calls it X11) style license, meaning more or less:
Do as thou wilst (with the software) shall be whole of the law.

To compile you will need libjack0, autotools and the mono c# compiler
installed.
