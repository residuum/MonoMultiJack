About MonoMultiJack

MonoMultJack (MMJ) aims to be an application for musicians, who regularly
have to deal with multiple programs to start and create and maintain
audio connections via jackd.


Building:
---------
You will need an installed version of jackd.

Windows:
--------
Execute Windows-build.bat
Fix any errors by installing missing libraries
You will get a self-contained zip file with all dll and MonoMultiJack.exe
Run MonoMultiJack.exe.


Linux:
------
Run 
$ bash Linux-build.sh

To build it with Gtk3 libraries:
$ bash Linux-build.sh Gtk3

You will get a tar.bz2 file with all dll and MonoMultiJack.exe
Running the extracted program:
$ exec mono "./MonoMultiJack.exe"


MMJ is written in C# using the Mono framework and is licensed with an
MIT (or as the FSF calls it X11) style license, meaning more or less:
Do as thou wilst (with the software) shall be whole of the law.

To compile you will need libjack0, autotools and the mono c# compiler
installed.
